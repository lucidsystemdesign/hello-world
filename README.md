# hello-world
This is the root of it all!
I am a software engeneeer based out of California I also grow lots of plants because of the boring yet somewhat predictable weather.
I have changed the ecosystem for the better in my backyard through the application of permaculture principles. 
I also am interested in robotics and have made a few sculptures using a lazer. 
Feel free to tell me a little bit about your self and what excites you!
